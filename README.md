# MRS_WavelengthCalibration
This repository contains a list of python notebooks that illustrate the wavelength calibration process for the different spectral bands of the MIRI MRS.  
  
List of notebooks per spectral band:  
0 - Band reference point  
1 - Spectrum offset of different slices  
2a - MIRI FM etalon line identification (single trace)  
2b - MIRI FM etalon line identification (all slices)  
3a - Fit 2D polynomial to entire slice (single slice)  
3b - Fit 2D polynomial to entire slice (all slices)  
4 - Evaluate new polynomial solution  
5 - Update the DISTORTION CDP
